#' Read DHC person NMF measurements as a noisy tibble
#'
#' Reads the 2020 DHC *person* Noisy Measurement File -- the noisy counts the
#' Census Bureau actually released under differential privacy. Its histogram
#' resolves sex and single-year age, which the PL94 release does not. Each
#' cell of the returned `value` column is a noisy value: the released number
#' plus a posterior over the true count (see [noisy_vec()]).
#'
#' Values returned by a single call are jointly consistent (for example,
#' cells the exact PL94 totals pin down sum to those totals). Values from
#' separate calls are treated as independent, so request every query you
#' plan to combine in one call. Use [dhc_queries()] to see the available
#' queries.
#'
#' @param geography One of `"us"`, `"state"`, or `"county"` (`"county"`
#'   requires `state`).
#' @param queries Query name or character vector of names, as listed by
#'   [dhc_queries()] (e.g. `"sex*hispanic"`). The `"detailed"` query alone
#'   has 1,227,744 cells per geography, so request it only for small areas.
#' @param state State FIPS code, postal abbreviation, or name; may be a
#'   vector.
#' @param county County FIPS code(s), to narrow a county-level read.
#' @param root Directory holding the fetched DHC parquet partitions.
#' @param nonnegative Truncate every posterior at zero, since true counts
#'   cannot be negative.
#' @param apply_constraints Condition posteriors on the constraints released
#'   alongside the noisy counts (the exact PL94 totals, age rules for group
#'   quarters, and group quarters bounds).
#' @return A tibble with one row per histogram cell: plain columns `geoid`,
#'   `geocode`, `aian`, `query`, one label column per axis (`relgq`, `sex`,
#'   `age`, `hispanic`, `cenrace`), `variance`, and a noisy `value` column.

#' Read named DHC variables as a tidy long table, tidycensus-style
#'
#' A drop-in replacement for
#' `tidycensus::get_decennial(variables = c(name = "P12_002N", ...))` when
#' `sumfile = "dhc"`: `variables` takes the same literal Census variable
#' codes tidycensus does. Each code is resolved into the [get_dhc()] query
#' and axis filter(s) that reconstruct that published cell from the actual
#' noisy measurements. The reconstruction is necessary because the
#' measurements were made against query workloads, not published table
#' cells; the lowest-variance query available for each cell is used.
#'
#' Only table P12 ("Sex by Age") is covered so far, and only 43 of its 49
#' codes: codes from other tables (`"P1_..."`, `"H1_..."`, etc.) error
#' clearly, as do 6 of P12's own codes -- Male/Female 20 years, 21 years,
#' and 22 to 24 years. Those six have no reliable NMF reconstruction: the
#' only query with single-year age resolution is `"detailed"`, and summing
#' the ~5,000 detailed cells one of these buckets marginalizes over
#' produces a posterior far from its own observed value (most of those
#' cells fall in PL94 constraint blocks with 3+ still-free cells, where the
#' block total is only an upper bound rather than a tight joint
#' constraint).
#' Every other P12 code checks out: its reconstruction's credible interval
#' sits tightly around its own observed value, as expected.
#'
#' Unlike `tidycensus::get_decennial()`, the returned tibble has no `NAME`
#' column: that requires a live FIPS-to-name geography lookup this package
#' doesn't have offline. Filter on `GEOID` instead.
#'
#' @param geography One of `"us"`, `"state"`, or `"county"` (`"county"`
#'   requires `state`).
#' @param variables A named character vector of literal Census variable
#'   codes, exactly as passed to `tidycensus::get_decennial()`, e.g.
#'   `c(male = "P12_002N", female = "P12_026N")`.
#' @param year Must be `2020` -- the only year this package has DHC data
#'   for. Accepted for call-shape parity with `tidycensus::get_decennial()`.
#' @param sumfile Must be `"dhc"`; other `tidycensus` sumfiles (e.g. `"pl"`)
#'   aren't wrapped by this function yet.
#' @param geometry Must be `FALSE`; this package doesn't return `sf`
#'   geometries. Accepted for call-shape parity with
#'   `tidycensus::get_decennial()`.
#' @param state,county,root,nonnegative,apply_constraints Passed through to
#'   [get_dhc()].
#' @return A tibble with columns `GEOID`, `geocode`, `aian`, `variable`, and
#'   a noisy `value` column -- one row per geography per requested
#'   variable, the same shape `tidycensus::get_decennial()` returns (plus
#'   `geocode`/`aian`, which carry DP-relevant provenance tidycensus has no
#'   analog for).
